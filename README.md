# Hello_World
Hello & Marhaba from the the Sadler Edepli lab at NYU Abu Dhabi!
We are a group of curious, dedicated biologists interested in figuring out how cells and genomes work to create complex organisms, to help them regenerate when injured and how those programs go wrong in response to signals that lead to cancer. We use zebrafish, mice and octopus to investigate how the epigenome is regulated, how the genome is organized in the nucleus and how these features regulate gene expression and suppress transposon threat.  All the work we do involves genomics.
